# FutureValuEstate

### We collaborated to create a dynamic web application in a short timeframe of 36 hours. Our efforts took place during the "StatusCode 0" hackathon, an event organized by "IIIT Kalyani" and held at IISER Kolkata. Despite the limited time constraints, our team managed to conceptualize, design, and implement this web application from the ground up. 

### We worked on Japan Prefecture-wise Land Dataset.

### We Futhermore worked on Japan Prefecture-wise  GDP(Gross Domestic Product) and Population as well as we developed a picture based value estimation using a combined regressor and cnn model.

### The focus of this work was Time-Series Forecasting ,Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Model Building and Deployment .

## In this work, We worked in different types of machine-learning algorithms.
1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) .
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) .
3. Additive Regression Model with Logistic Growth .

## Streamlit web application using vscode for windows :

### Follow the below steps:

1. Open your vscode and click the new terminal. Use the ``Ctrl+Shift+`  `` keyboard shortcut to create a new terminal.

2. Create a new set up virtual environment. A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, 
directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects. Run this code :
`` python -m venv private ``

3. Activating the virtual environment : `` private\Scripts\activate ``

4. Installation of required packages to the virtual environment.

- A. Install Streamlit :	`` pip install streamlit ``

5. Get  Requirements File. This file is a checklist for the Python application in question. It lists all libraries and associated versions used in the app. 
To get requirements.txt file, navigate in the " main " Directory 

To install requirements.txt (To install all the dependencies) : ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
  
6. Run Streamlit as a Python module : `` streamlit run FutureValuEstate.py ``

7. Final deployment is being done on the streamlit community
